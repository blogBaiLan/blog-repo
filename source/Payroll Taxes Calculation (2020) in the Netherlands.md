# Payroll Taxes Calculation (2020) in the Netherlands

## What Are Payroll Taxes?

Payroll taxes are taxes imposed on employers and/or employees. In the Netherlands, some parts of payroll taxes is withheld by employers from employee's gross wage and employers themselves pay the other parts.

Payroll taxes consist of four parts:

1. **Wage Tax**

    It is withheld by employers from gross wages.

2. **National Insurance Contributions**

    It is withheld by employers from gross wages. 

    The contributions insure residents and employees in the Netherlands against the financial consequences of old age, death, exceptional medical expenses and costs of children. 

    The contributions consist of:

    - General Old Age Pensions Act (AOW)
    - Surviving Dependants Act (Anw)
    - Long-Term Care Act (Wet langdurige zorg, Wlz)
    - General Child Benefit Act (AKW)

    Only General Child Benefit Act (AKW) is not obliged to be withheld.

3. **Employed Person's Insurance Contributions**

    Employers bear the full cost of the contribution.

    This scheme insures employees against the financial consequences of illness, occupational disability and unemployment. 

    The contribution consist of:

    - Sickness Benefits Act (ZW)
    - Invalidity Insurance Act (WAO) / Work and Income according to Work Capacity Act (WIA)
    - Unemployment Insurance Act (WW)
4. **Income-Dependent Contribution Pursuant to the Health Care Insurance Act (Zvw)**

    Employees are obliged to take out Dutch Basic Insurance and pay a premium to a health care insurer by their choice. This premium is not part of payroll taxes. Besides employees' own contribution (premium), employers also contribute to Zvw for employees. Thus, this part is also taken care of by employers.

## How to Calculate Payroll taxes?

**ATTENTION**: *The calculations and examples are only applicable to general cases. Special rules may apply to elderlies, foreign employees (30% ruling), disabilities, living in neighbor countries etc.*

First of all, calculations for all 4 parts of payroll taxes are based on the same wage amount, namely gross wages. The most important forms of wages are wages in monetary terms, such as the employee's salary, holiday allowance, overtime pay, commission, year-end bonus (the 13th month) and all other monetary payments to the employee.

Normally wage tax and national insurance contributions are calculated together. And they are the only two parts that related to employees' interests. There are two bands for wage tax/national insurance contributions:

1. 37.35%: annual gross wages < €68,508
2. 49.50%: annual gross wages ≥ €68,508

These are already sufficient to calculate one's payroll taxes (of employee's interests). 

**Examples**: 

1) One's annual gross wages are €50,000 then the wage tax/national insurance contributions are €50,000 x 37.35% = €18,675

2) One's annual gross wages are €80,000 then the wage tax/national insurance contributions are €68,508 x 37.35% + (€80,000 - €68,508) x 49.50%= €31,276

This [table](https://download.belastingdienst.nl/belastingdienst/dl/rekenhulpen/loonheffing/2020/v01/pdf/wit_mnd_nl_std_alg_20200101.pdf) from [Dutch Tax and Customs Administration](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/nl/home/home) is very handy to look up one's wage tax/national insurance contributions. The first column shows monthly wages, the second column is wage tax/national insurance contributions, the third is wage tax/national insurance contributions with tax credits (General Tax Credits and Labour Tax Credit) applied, the fourth lists Labour Tax Credit separately. Normally, the number listed in the third column is one's wage tax/national insurance contributions withheld by employers. Tax Credits will be covered in a moment.

Tables of this kind that take special situations into account can be found at [this site](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/nl/personeel-en-loon/content/hulpmiddel-loonbelastingtabellen).

The following sections explain the calculation of the 4 parts of payroll taxes.

### Wage Tax Calculation:

There are three bands:

1. 09.70%: annual gross wages < €34,712
2. 37.35%: €34,712 ≤ annual gross wages < €68,508
3. 49.50%: €68,508 ≤ annual gross wages

**Examples**:

One's annual gross wages are €80,000 then the wage tax is €34,712 x 9.70% + (€68,508 - €34,712) x 37.35% + (€80,000 - €68,508) x 49.50%= €21,678

### **National Insurance Contributions (NIC)** Calculation:

As mentioned in the previous section, this part has three obliged items. Their corresponding percentages that should be withheld from gross wages are as follows:


| Items        | Rates         |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| General Old Age Pensions Act (AOW)      | 17.90%|
| Surviving Dependants Act (Anw): 0.10%      | 0.10%      |
| Long-Term Care Act (Wet langdurige zorg, Wlz) | 9.65%      |
| Total | 27.65% |


NIC only applies to the part of  of gross wages that is below €34,712. Therefore, if one's annual wages is below €34,712 then one have to pay 9.70% + 27.65% (wage tax + national insurance contributions), which "accidentally" equals to 37.35%. This is the reason why one can combine the first and the second band of in Wage Tax calculation when calculating wage tax/national insurance contributions.

Also because that NIC only applies to the part of  of gross wages that is below €34,712, the maximum NIC one would pay is €34,712 x 27.65% = €9285.46

### Employed Persons' Insurance Contributions Calculation

*This part and the next are not relevant to employees; thus not throughly investigated. Those who speak Dutch can read the [handbook](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/themaoverstijgend/brochures_en_publicaties/handboek-loonheffingen-2020) to obtain more information.*

Contributions have [3 parts](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/business/payroll_taxes/you_are_not_established_in_the_netherlands_are_you_required_to_withhold_payroll_taxes/when_you_are_going_to_withhold_payroll_taxes/calculating_payroll_taxes/calculating_employed_persons_insurance_contributions/):

1. **General Unemployment Fund Contribution**

    The low contribution for 2020 is 2.94% and the high contribution 7.94%.

2. **Basic Contributions Under the Occupational Disability Insurance Act (WAO)/ Income provision (fully disabled workers) Regulation (IVA)/Partially Disabled Workers Act (WGA)**

    The basic contribution for the WAO/IVA/WGA is the same for all employers. The basic contribution for 2020 is 6.77%. For 2020 the surcharge is 0.50%. The total basic contribution for the WAO/IVA/WGA, including child care benefit, is 7.27%.

3. **Differentiated Contributions Under the Return to Work Fund (Whk)**

    It differs according to the nature of employers' sectors.

The calculation is based on the wages that are the same as that for wage tax/national insurance contributions. But there's a [maximum wages](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/business/payroll_taxes/you_are_not_established_in_the_netherlands_are_you_required_to_withhold_payroll_taxes/when_you_are_going_to_withhold_payroll_taxes/calculating_payroll_taxes/rates/rates-for-2020/table-11-wage-period-amounts-maximum-income-assessable-for-social-security-2020) for this. For example monthly maximum wage is € 4,769.33. The calculation is carried out using [progressive accrual calculations](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/business/payroll_taxes/you_are_not_established_in_the_netherlands_are_you_required_to_withhold_payroll_taxes/when_you_are_going_to_withhold_payroll_taxes/calculating_payroll_taxes/calculating_employed_persons_insurance_contributions/calculating_with_progressive_accrual_calculations).

### **Income-Dependent Contribution Pursuant to the Health Care Insurance Act (Zvw) Calculation**:

*This part is not relevant to employees; thus not throughly investigated. Those who speak Dutch can read the [handbook](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/themaoverstijgend/brochures_en_publicaties/handboek-loonheffingen-2020) to obtain more information.*

The calculation is also carried out using progressive accrual calculations and has a maximum wages.

## Tax Credits

**ATTENTION**: *Tax credits mentioned here are only two widely applied ones. Special tax credits may apply to elderlies, disabilities etc.*

Here we only discuss two tax credits that are widely used. Almost everyone is entitled to these two tax credits. I said "almost" because I didn't find the official explanations, the purpose of them either.

1. General Tax Credit (Dutch: algemene heffingskorting)

    The following rules are copied from [this site](https://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-info/allowances-benefits-netherlands/dutch-tax-credits).

    - €2.711 for those with gross wages under €20.711.
    - €2.711 - 5,672% x (taxable income - €20.711) for people with gross wages €20.711 to €68.507.
    - €0 for people with gross wages over €68.507.
2. Labour Tax Credit (Dutch: arbeidskorting)

    The following rules are copied from [this site](https://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-info/allowances-benefits-netherlands/dutch-tax-credits).

    - €0-€9.921: 2.812% x gross wages
    - €9.921-€21.430: €279 + 28.812% x (gross wages - €9.921)
    - €21.430-€34.954: €3.595 + 1.656% x (gross wages - €21.430)
    - €34.954-€98.604: €3.819 - 6% x (gross wages - €34.954)
    - €98.604: €0

Thus, the net wages you receive equals **gross wags** - **payroll taxes** + **tax credits.**
